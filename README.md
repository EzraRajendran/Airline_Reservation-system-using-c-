# Airline Reservation System

## Overview

The **Airline Reservation System** is a console-based application developed in C++. It allows users to book, cancel, and view flight reservations, as well as manage seat availability for flights. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, file handling, and data management in C++.

## Features

- **Flight Management**: View available flights, check flight details, and search for flights by destination and date.
- **Reservation System**: Book, cancel, and modify flight reservations.
- **Passenger Information**: Store and retrieve passenger details, including names, contact information, and flight preferences.
- **Seat Management**: Allocate and manage seats for passengers.
- **File Handling**: Store flight and reservation data in files for persistent storage.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive console-based interface to interact with the system.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts Used**: Object-oriented programming (OOP), File Handling, Data Structures, and Exception Handling.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airline-reservation-system.git
   ```

2. **Compile the program**:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o airlineReservationSystem
   ```

3. **Run the executable**:
   ```bash
   ./airlineReservationSystem   # On Linux/Mac
   airlineReservationSystem.exe  # On Windows
   ```

## File Structure

- `main.cpp`: The main driver program of the airline reservation system.
- `flights.dat`: Stores information about available flights.
- `reservations.dat`: Stores booking details and passenger information.

## Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Integrate a real-time database for flight and reservation data management.
- Implement a more sophisticated search and filtering system for flights.
- Add features for frequent flyer programs and special discounts.
